### Project Summary

This project aims to analyze HR data using a snowflake schema to gain insights into various HR metrics. The analysis is performed using Power BI, which is well-suited for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

### Power BI Visualization

Using Power BI, the following visualizations and insights can be created:

1. **Employee Demographics**:
   - Visualizations of employee demographics such as age, gender, and department distribution using bar charts and pie charts.

2. **Employee Performance**:
   - Dashboards showing performance metrics across different departments and roles, using line charts and bar graphs to track performance trends.

3. **Hiring Trends**:
   - Analysis of hiring trends over time, visualized through line charts to identify peak hiring periods and trends in new hires.

4. **Attrition Analysis**:
   - Visualizations that highlight attrition rates and the reasons for employee departures, helping to identify patterns and potential areas of concern.

5. **Salary Distribution**:
   - Analysis of salary distribution across different roles and departments using box plots and histograms.

6. **Training and Development**:
   - Insights into training and development programs, showing participation rates and the impact on employee performance and retention.

### Tools Used

- **Power BI**: The tool used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations. Power BI's features enable detailed analysis and presentation of HR data.

### Data Model

- **Snowflake Schema**: The data is organized using a snowflake schema, which normalizes the data into multiple related tables. This structure helps in organizing complex data relationships and improves query performance.

### Insights Gained

This project leverages Power BI to provide comprehensive insights into HR metrics, including employee demographics, performance, hiring trends, attrition rates, salary distribution, and training programs. By using a snowflake schema, the data is efficiently organized, allowing for detailed and accurate analysis. The visualizations created in Power BI help stakeholders understand key HR metrics and make informed decisions to improve HR processes and employee satisfaction.
